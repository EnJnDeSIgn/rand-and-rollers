Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

a person can, wonder unaware you know
but some times you should just wonder,
other times it's better be unaware though.

you know a person can be unaware wondering
then aw and wonder of whats really out side

and in front of them,
like the inner child of an artist

then wonder unaware wondering less and
less, better and better
