Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

i respect the ones i don't care at all about
i brought up my friends that way at lest
a friend respects i don't care at all

of course i must be worthy of respect
i can respect a friend's respect
but i hope at lest that my friend will respect me, if
only for leaving them to respect the people
that respect me or not
