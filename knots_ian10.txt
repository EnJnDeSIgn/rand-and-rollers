Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris


Jesus was having fun playing the game,
but we are doing it wrong if we dont know
there is always somthing the matter with us,
even if it is hard work

there must be somthing the matter with him
he wouldnt be acting like they were unless
there is somthing the matter with them and
the one thing the matter us
is we didnt think anything was the matter
with me
