Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris


love because, you don't care at all.
don't care at all, because you love.

i would be happy if you don't care at all
if you don't care at all i would be happy

i don't care at all
i know how to love
because you love
we don't care at all

we are happy
i am happy
they are happy
