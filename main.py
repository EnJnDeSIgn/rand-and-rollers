1. Identify the Main Topics: Determine the central ideas or themes for the story.
2. Determine the Messages: Decide what you want to communicate through these themes.
3. Develop a Theme Statement: Formulate a clear and concise statement summarizing the theme.
4. Weave the Themes into the Story: Use characters, settings, conflicts, and dialogue to highlight the themes naturally.
5. Reinforce Through Repetition: Subtly remind the reader of the themes throughout the story.
6. Show, Donâ€™t Tell: Demonstrate the themes through actions and events rather than stating them explicitly.
7. Revise and Refine: After completing your first draft, review and refine how the themes are integrated.

2. Rising Action: Develop the protagonist's journey toward achieving their goals.
3. Climax: Create a pivotal moment where the protagonist faces a major challenge or realization.
4. Falling Action: Explore the consequences of the climax. Show how the protagonist deals with the outcomes.
5. Resolution: Conclude the protagonist's arc in a satisfying way.
6. Theme Integration: Ensure each scene and chapter reflects the central themes.
7. Review and Refine: Review the outline to ensure coherence and alignment with the themes.
