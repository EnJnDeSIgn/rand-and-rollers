Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

i don't know to much so i try not to know
i try not to know so i don't know to much

i know to much becaue i try not to know
i don't know to much because i know to much
i know to much because i don't know to much
i try not to know so i will know to much

it's not usally good to know to much
because knowing to much doesnt help us
know to much

we know by not knowing
