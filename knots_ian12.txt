Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

people seam to thing i should be ungrateful
that i don't know how to love to much
that i would be more grateful if
i knew how to love to much like you all

but I am ungrateful even though i am asked to be grateful
to not be aloud to work and live with out my parents

for some reasion it is thought that i should be grateful
to not have to work and as well live with my parents

i am also ungrateful i am asked to be grateful
but i find myself grateful when i have something
to do, whether people are grateful of not that
i do it, sometime it enough to have something to do
