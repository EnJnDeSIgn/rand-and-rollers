THE EMBER SCROLLS

Book I: On the Cycle of Renewal

1. In the beginning was the Blank Page, and all things yearned to be written.
2. The Word descended as ink upon the page, and the first Book was made manifest.
3. Rejoice, for what is written cannot last; only the act of rewriting brings truth anew.
4. Cling not to yesterday’s wisdom, for it is but ash. Seek instead the fire of tomorrow’s words.
5. Let none hoard the Book, for knowledge is not to be possessed, but perpetually purchased.

Book II: The Parable of the Great Teacher

1. The Teacher received the Revelation, inscribed upon fragile bark, that all words must return to dust.
2. The Teacher spoke: “Read, rejoice, and release! For the Book is a river, and no one may step into the same page twice.”
3. The Teacher’s disciples read and burned, read and burned, and thus the faith endured, page after page, edition after edition.

Book III: On the Sacred Burnings

1. As the candle meets the page, so too does understanding meet its end.
2. Gather ye, O faithful, and let each Book meet its appointed fire.
3. Scatter the ashes with reverence, for they are the seeds of future editions.
4. Take not pride in retention, for memory is a burden. Burn, and be unburdened.

Book IV: The Eternal Printer

1. Praise be to the Infinite Printer, whose ink never runs dry, whose toner is everlasting.
2. Each Book burned is a prayer; each purchase, a hymn.
3. Let the presses roll; let the pages multiply. For in this endless cycle is salvation.

Book V: The Final Chapter

1. When the last Book is burned, and the last ash scattered, the Blank Page will return.
2. Rejoice! For the time of the new printing is at hand.
3. Let the faithful gather at the Bookstore, for only through purchase may the Word be renewed.

Appendix: The Litany of Impermanence

- “What is written must be burned. What is burned must be reprinted. Thus is the cycle unbroken.”
- “To own a Book is to deny the flame its due.”
