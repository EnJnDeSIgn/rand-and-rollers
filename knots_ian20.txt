Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris


you already know the answer, your not ready to accept
not ready to accept that you know the answer already
answer already accepted but you don't even know yet

later you accept you already knew the answer but
your not ready to accept knowing you knew it

accept you know you will knew not knowing later

a little girl comes along and says you knew, knowing
you were not ready to know you knew you answer already
but it's okay a Déjà vu just means you on the right path
my zhan zhuang friend just like to be in to moment and
thats probable healthier because less is more
