! Steps to Implement Newton's Method
! Define the Function and its Derivative: You need the function for which you want to find the root and its derivative.

! Initial Guess: Start with an initial guess of the root.

! Iterative Formula: Use the formula to find a better approximation:

𝑥𝑛+1=𝑥𝑛−𝑓(𝑥𝑛) / 𝑓′(𝑥𝑛)
! Repeat this step until convergence.

! Example: Find the Root of 
𝑓(𝑥)=𝑥^3−2𝑥^2+𝑥−3
! Function: 
𝑓(𝑥)=𝑥^3−2𝑥^2+𝑥−3

! Derivative: 
𝑓′(𝑥)=3𝑥^2−4𝑥+1
