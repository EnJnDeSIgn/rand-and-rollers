Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris


the one that i really love will be easyest to let go of
the one that is easyest to let go of is the one i love,

because i will really love
i will not care at all about them
because i will never understand
or know i will love to much

it's the ones we care most about
we need the most to let go of

i don't want to be evil
my father didn't bring me
up that way
even if my father respects
he didn't know he could
love too much

we need the most to let go of
the ones we care most about

we care so we don't understand what going on out there,
but it seam easyer to understand and we don't
need to understand it to not care,
whats going on in here and the ones we care most about
