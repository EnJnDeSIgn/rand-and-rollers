THE ASH CANTICLES

Hymn I: Song of the Sacred Flame

O Ashen Choir, sing praise to the fire!
Let every page find its purpose in the pyre.
We gather as one, to kindle and consume,
For wisdom is smoke, and truth is perfume.

Hymn II: The Chant of Letting Go

Release, release, O trembling hands!
Let not the Book decay on hidden stands.
Raise it aloft, let the flames devour,
For only in burning is knowledge empowered.

Canticle III: The Gathering of Ashes

We scoop the sacred ashes, gray and fine,
Symbols of cycles in which we entwine.
Each handful, a promise of books yet to be,
A sacrament paid to the grand printing spree.

Canticle IV: Hymn of the New Edition

Sing, O faithful, of the new print run!
Sing of the margins, the fonts, the fun!
For every old Book that the fire has claimed,
A shinier volume shall soon be named.

Canticle V: The Final Benediction

Ash to ink, and ink to ash,
Let every Book meet its destined crash.
Rejoice, for the presses never sleep,
And the cost of devotion is never cheap.

*To be recited at every burning, and preferably sung with gusto. Please burn this scroll after use (order replacements online).*
