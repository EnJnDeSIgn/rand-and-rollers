Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris


the problem with people that
are hard to let go of,
because they make someone
eles hard to let go of

they want to get away with things
they should not get away with

they should not get away with
things they get away with

when they make someone eles
hard to let go of

people don't see they get away
with things they get away with

when they make someone eles
hard to let go of

it is thought that they are easy,
and someone eles is hard to let of

things they get away with people 
don't see they get away with
