Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

They think there must be something the matter with him,
because they would not be acting as they are to him
unless there was

Therefore they are acting as they are because there is
something the matter with them not him.
They do not think there is anything the matter with them

Because
One of the things that is the matter with them is that
they think that there is anything the matter with him

Therefore
He has to help them realize that, the fact that they do
not think there is anything the matter with them is one
of the things that is the matter with them.

What is not the matter with him is he already knows
there is always something the matter with him.
