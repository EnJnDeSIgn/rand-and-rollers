		Itâ€™s interesting to hear that youâ€™re using
		a smaller version of dice to increase
		randomness. The concept of a power set,
		which is the set of all subsets of a set,
		including the empty set and the set
		itself, can indeed be used in the context
		of probability and randomness. For
		example, if you have a set of dice
		outcomes, the power set would include all
		possible combinations of those outcomes.
		In mathematical terms, if ( S ) is a set
	with ( n ) elements, then the power set
	of ( S ) would have ( 2^n ) elements,
	representing all the possible
	combinations. Hereâ€™s how it looks in a
	formula:
			P(S)=2n
	Where ( P(S) ) is the power set of ( S ),
	and ( n ) is the number of elements in
	set ( S ).
	Smaller dice could theoretically offer
	more random outcomes due to their size
	and the way they interact with the
	surface theyâ€™re rolled on. Itâ€™s a
	clever approach to randomness in games
	or simulations! If you need any further
	assistance with probability, randomness,
	or any other topic, feel free to ask.
	Happy rolling! ðŸŽ²
