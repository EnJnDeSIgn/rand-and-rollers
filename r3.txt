THE PRINTER'S ALMANAC

Preface

Welcome, Devotee of the Ever-Turning Page! Within these pages you will find the sacred instructions for proper observance of the burning cycle, the timing of festivals, and the etiquette of perpetual renewal.

Chapter I: The Calendar of Burnings

- **First Reading Festival** (Spring): Purchase new editions. Read with enthusiasm; burn with reverence.
- **The Ember Equinox** (Summer): Community bonfires; mass ashing of outdated editions.
- **The Sale of Sorrows** (Autumn): Dispose of books that no longer “spark joy.” Special discounts on new printings.
- **The Ashen Vigil** (Winter): Read by candlelight, then use the candle to light the sacrificial pyre.

Chapter II: Rituals & Etiquette

- Before Burning: Always read the Book (skimming counts). Recite “For tomorrow’s wisdom, I offer today’s words.”
- During Burning: Chant the Ash Canticles. Encourage group participation for maximal spiritual and economic effect.
- After Burning: Collect ashes in the official “Renewal Urn” (sold separately).
- Ashes may be scattered in sacred gardens, pressed into commemorative coins, or used as fertilizer for the Tree of New Editions.

Chapter III: The Sacred Marketplace

- Only authorized BookSellers may provide “canonical” editions. Accept no imitations—look for the official watermark (“Blessed by the Printer”).
- Bartering books is heresy; each copy must be bought anew.
- Discounts available for bulk burning events and family ceremonies.

Chapter IV: Special Ceremonies

- **Birth:** Present the newborn with a blank Book. Parents must vow to fill it with disposable wisdom.
- **Coming-of-Age:** The adolescent burns their childhood Book before the community.
- **Marriage:** The couple selects a shared Book and burns it together, symbolizing united impermanence.
- **Death:** The final Book is burned on behalf of the deceased, ashes scattered at the Bookstore threshold.

Appendix: Approved Chants, Blessings, and Penalties

- “May your ashes be ever plentiful and your margins ever wide.”
- Penalty for hoarding: Excommunication and mandatory purchase of five new Books.
- Penalty for copying without purchase: Eternal printer jam.
