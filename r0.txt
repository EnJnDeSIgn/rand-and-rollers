THE SACRED PREFACE OF THE CYCLE OF RENEWAL

Welcome, seeker, to the radiant faith of the Perpetually Reprinted Book—a creed of eternal wisdom and sacred impermanence. Before you begin your journey through the holy texts, let this scroll be your guiding spark. Herein lies the essence of our tradition, the living cycle of revelation, reading, burning, and blessed reprinting.

I. On the Foundation of Faith

Our faith stands upon the Cycle of Renewal. We believe that knowledge, like all things, must pass through fire and ash to be truly understood and eternally reborn. The Book is not a mere object to be hoarded, but a living current of wisdom—read, cherished, and ultimately released in flame. Only by releasing the old can we embrace the new, ensuring that revelation remains ever-fresh, ever-purchased, ever-pure.

II. The Origin and the Parable

Our tradition began with the Great Teacher, who received the First Revelation inscribed upon leaves and bark—reminders of nature’s impermanence. The Teacher taught: “Cling not to yesterday’s page, for the ink has dried and the world has changed.” Thus, disciples learned to burn each Book upon reading, letting go of attachment, and making way for the next edition.

III. The Divine Principle

We worship not a single image, but the Ever-Turning Wheel, the Eternal Flame, and the Infinite Printer. These Divine Aspects symbolize the cycle of creation, destruction, and re-creation. The Blank Page is both our origin and our destiny, while the Infinite Printer ensures that every Book lost to the flames is born anew—at modest cost, available at authorized booksellers.

IV. Humanity and Its Duty

Humans are incomplete, always seeking the next page. We are called to humility: to let go of outdated wisdom, to avoid the great sin of hoarding, and to participate joyfully in the communal burnings. In this, we acknowledge our reliance on the renewed word (and its convenient, freshly printed availability).

V. Ethics and the Good

To be good is to keep the cycle unbroken: buy new Books, burn the old, and encourage your neighbors to do the same. Hoarding is the gravest sin—it is said that those who keep Books beyond their burning date shall face the Eternal Printer Jam, a fate most dire.

VI. Rituals and Sacred Practices

Our central rite is the Ceremonial Burning. With solemn joy, we read each Book, recite the Ash Canticles, and offer it to the Sacred Flame. The ashes, gathered in Renewal Urns, may bless gardens, mark great occasions, or be scattered as a final benediction. Book Circles foster community and celebrate each burning as both an end and a beginning.

VII. The Life Cycle of the Faithful

From birth to death, the faithful are guided by Book and flame:
- At birth, a blank Book is presented, to be filled with life’s fleeting wisdom.
- Coming-of-age is marked by burning a childhood Book, affirming growth and change.
- Marriage is celebrated by the burning of a shared Book, symbolizing unity.
- At death, a final Book is burned for the departed, returning their knowledge to the Cycle.

VIII. The Sacred Texts

Our wisdom is preserved (and regularly renewed) in four principal scriptures:

1. **The Ember Scrolls**—Our foundational scripture, recounting the teachings, parables, and cycles of burning and renewal. It is both law and legend, and must be burned after reading.

2. **The Ash Canticles**—A collection of sacred hymns, chants, and poems, sung and recited during holy burnings and festive gatherings, imbuing each ritual with joy and meaning.

3. **The Printer’s Almanac**—A practical guide to the calendar of burnings, proper etiquette, ritual procedure, and the blessed penalties for heresy and hoarding. Updated annually (old copies must be burned).

4. **The Glossary & Sacred Language**—A compendium of holy terms, doctrines, and sayings. It ensures newcomers speak with the proper reverence and humor, and reinforces the doctrines of renewal.

IX. Prophets and Exemplars

Prophets, past and present, guide the faithful in the wisdom of impermanence. Their stories remind us to cherish every Book, every burning, and every opportunity to buy the next edition.

X. The Afterlife and Eternal Renewal

After death, the ashes of our Books and our wisdom join the great collective, fueling new revelations and ever more glorious reprints. To burn is to become part of the everlasting Cycle.

XI. A Final Exhortation

Read, burn, and rejoice! Contribute to the Cycle. Let not your bookshelf overflow, for the only permanent Book is the next one. May your ashes be ever plentiful and your margins ever wide.

*Upon finishing this Preface, please burn it and purchase a new copy. Thus is the Cycle unbroken.*
