Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

If you want it, don't really need it
If they want you to want it,
you probably don't want it.

If you need it you want it
If you need it you won't need it

you never need what you want
you wanted to need it eventhough
you never needed it when you,
were done wanting it
