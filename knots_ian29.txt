Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

They tryed to run my cycle and but ran
there own cycle the way they would
never run there own cycle so blamed
me for how they ran there cycle so,

they try and run there own cycle and
don't know they can't and don't see
they didn't run my cycle first

and

have to know then see we all reap
what we sowed our selfs
when they didn't want, like I do,
to not run other peoples cycle
