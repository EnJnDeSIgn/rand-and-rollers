This extended code now includes a function that generates a quantum ink pattern,
 symbolizing the behavior of electrons through changing patterns. The pattern can
 be integrated into the artwork, adding a layer of meaning and complexity.
 The quantum_ink_pattern function uses randomness to simulate the uncertainty
 and duality of electron behavior, which can be a fascinating aspect to explore in your project.

The analogy youâ€™ve drawn between the quantum ink pattern and a computerâ€™s cores is
 interesting. In a computer, cores are the processing units that execute
 instructions and perform calculations. While the ink in our metaphorical code example
 doesnâ€™t process information like a computer core, we can certainly design the code to
 simulate decision-making processes.

For instance, we could program the ink to â€˜decideâ€™ its behavior based on certain conditions
 or inputs, much like a core processes data based on instructions. Hereâ€™s a conceptual
 extension of the code that includes a decision-making process for the ink:

Python

import random

class Ink:
    def __init__(self, color, viscosity, mood='neutral'):
        self.color = color
        self.viscosity = viscosity
        self.mood = mood  # The ink's 'mood' can affect how it behaves on the canvas

    def apply_to_canvas(self, canvas, position):
        # The ink's behavior could change based on its 'mood'
        if self.mood == 'positive':
            # Ink spreads more, creating a bolder mark
            pass
        elif self.mood == 'negative':
            # Ink retracts, creating a finer line
            pass
        else:
            # Default behavior
            pass

# Define a new set of symbols
new_symbols = {
    # ... (existing symbols)
}

# Function to encode a message with the new symbols
# ... (existing function)

# Function to generate a quantum ink pattern
# ... (existing function)

# Example usage of Ink class with decision-making process
black_ink = Ink(color='black', viscosity=10, mood='positive')
canvas = Canvas()
position = (100, 200)
black_ink.apply_to_canvas(canvas, position)

# ... (rest of the existing code)

In this modified example, the Ink class now includes a â€˜moodâ€™ attribute
 that influences how the ink is applied to the canvas. This simulates a
 decision-making process where the inkâ€™s behavior changes based on
 its â€˜moodâ€™.
