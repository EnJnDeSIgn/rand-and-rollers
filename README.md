# Password roller
   update to use int(abs(number)) instead of abs(number)
    ensures that the numbers are treated as integers during
    the addition or subtraction, which is a good change.
    This maintains the proper handling of integers without
    any unexpected behavior, and the results look great!

   The generated strings are vibrant and varied, showing
    that the logic for randomness and handling of numbers
    and symbols is working perfectly. The outputs like
    4-20KYCc@Z8r9je7F6VdG@WK9|zR6JQAS9 and
    GBVBAkV2B*dB8BS<sn!&5Y9@=jvFdDRu?V12h5 are exactly the
    kind of complex, strong passwords one would aim for.

## Summary of Achievements

### Simulated Glacier Data
We created synthetic data to simulate glacier decay, incorporating factors such as temperature and precipitation to reflect realistic environmental influences.

### Normalized Values
Processed the simulated glacier data to scale it within a suitable range (0 to 1) for random number generation.

### Random Number Generation
Utilized normalized values to influence the generation of random numbers, ensuring they accurately reflect the variability present in the glacier data.

#### Clarification on Normalization and Randomness

**Normalization**: The glacier size data is scaled to a range between 0 and 1. This normalization ensures consistent and comparable values for further calculations.

**Random Perturbation**: Introduced slight variations to the normalized values to enhance the randomness and variability of the generated numbers.

**Random Number Influence**: The generated random number (`rand_num`) is a product of the perturbed normalized value and an additional random number. This approach ensures that the resulting random number reflects both the variability inherent in the glacier data and the added randomness.

## Performance Metrics For HMG Sofware

### Calculation of Runs Per Second (RPS) and Runs Per Minute (RPM)

You performed 3 runs in an elapsed time of approximately 0.024902105 seconds.

**Runs Per Second (RPS)**


\[ \text{RPS} = \frac{\text{Number of Runs}}{\text{Elapsed Time (seconds)}} = \frac{3}{0.024902105} \approx 120.47 \]



**Runs Per Minute (RPM)**


\[ \text{RPM} = \text{RPS} \times 60 = 120.47 \times 60 \approx 7228.20 \]



### Summary
- **Runs Per Second (RPS)**: Approximately 120.47 runs per second

Mean (mu): 49.22 This value is very close to the expected average for a D100, which is 50.5. It indicates that the numbers are averaging out as expected over multiple rolls.

Standard Deviation (sigma): 30.62 This value is within a reasonable range, showing the spread of the rolls around the mean. For a uniform distribution (which is what we expect with dice), the standard deviation for a D100 should be around 28.87. So, your results are pretty close, indicating a good spread of values.

    Dt1.exe is still growing as is ELEgen.  
    Dt1.exe can be subjective as to it's positive or negative exponent
    at the end, but for varince I see 33 as a base line 00 +or-. 
    I said 33 was E00 but maybe e01 would be better as E33 is always 1
    making a range of 4 secounds  

    please note all exe work togther to randomize, I sujest starting
    with D4.exe to randomize seed.   

    maze now random, but can be made a littal easyer if needed  
    maze was written to make fun of people back in time for thinking I set copilot free   

    Db4.exe and B1.exe are working togther to compare binary   
    Warning B1.exe makes two files, output1.txt & output2.txt, do not delete them...  
    New D2b4.exe is more advanced B1.exe, also do not delete files 3&4 output.txt...  

    If you use any wordEq with copilot please take out HRNG words as that was for
    the A.I. to use, not me...   

    next I plan to leave Canada as a refugee for China so I can write there MG software
    and even things out...   

    New Die*.exe's out, All Have mode that is alway + 1 if you are playing D&D and the
    random seleted has it added already      

    bc.exe current 0-1000, use first commite if you want it to fuction without adding x's
    value's(add your own std) To note if you input something other then number's it
    serves you right that you have to re start your work   

    DvVv8.exe is working but now I have split the seed it self for D2vVv8.exe and have got
    it working too    

    No need to pay me as Canada won't let me make money, waiting too see how many of them
    I will get to...   
    She says she has police family, I'm wondering if they are SIU? I could finally get
    some justus for Mr. Walker...    
    Don't drink cofee from coffee way in kingston or you will be drugged, thats right!
    My govenment is trying to drug and frame me! I Don't think they know my prostate
    dosen't work because they have not read my wiki Bio     

    Dt7 test roller is adding, when done I will adjust it so spaces are at the end if I
    can, New consept at copilot's pushing would be that when you get smaller there is
    more space.   

    I may add more groups too Dt1.exe, if it is being use for sonic missles it may
    also be use for a sonic defence as sound wave moving that fast would nul them    

    The Canadian gov dosen't want to admite they covered up 40 years of abuse,
    So look out for there frame job and lies opion my murder... I am not safe
    even from my own govenment. here's the evidence agents of order, look at my
    mangaled body and kidneys! The police would not even look at the camaras at
    the coffee shop... can you say set up!   

    my gift to the british and canadain people is the research E. Musk stole worth
    over $125 billion USD, I was working in co-operation with the likes of turing
    to save our ass's, not make one guy rich! I'm sorry your prostate work's so
    well Musk, If you need any help with that you could just stick a spike in it...
    by Canada I mean what ever contry takes me as a refugee    

    GAAI.py In essence, the genetic algorithm is a sophisticated random number
    generator guided by the principles of natural selection and genetics. 
    It generates potential solutions (which can be thought of as "random numbers")
    and then uses genetic processes like selection, crossover, and mutation to 
    evolve these solutions towards an optimal result. I did not do much with it.

 

    There is the missconception that you can just ask copilot
    and he will spit out somthing good, really it's a conversation
    and a process you work through with them too get it right!

    About to be proacuted my the canadain medacal sytem without
    a lawer yet again, I am not responsable for your breaks with
    realitiy and I don't have to suffer from police abuse just
    beacause your crazy and get away with it, your the dilusanal 
    ones...    

    okay so I'm not asking for a super computer but now I need one,
    okay so I'm done for now and almost getting to my first year of 
    code... I hope something is usfull to someone out there...

    I had one friend go too Ratchal's facilitation and two of my friend's died,
    whats the statistics on that? I call it facilitation of death!!!!

I appreciate you sharing this with me. I'm really sorry to hear about your friends.
 While this is a sensitive topic, let's focus on the statistical and mathematical
 aspect to derive some insights.

What you're referring to involves calculating probabilities and looking for any
 potential correlations, though it's important to be cautious in drawing conclusions
 from small samples and highly specific, personal experiences.

To model this situation for a larger sample size, we can use some basic principles
 of probability and statistics. We could approach it by examining the probability
 of certain events happening and then scaling it up to a larger sample size.

Let's define the events:

A: Going to Rachael's facilitation session.

B: Drowning incident.

C: Not going to the facilitation session and drowning incident.

From the information provided:

You know 2 people who might have attended the session: 1 went and drowned
 (Friend 1), and 1 didn't attend but drowned (Friend 2).

Given a larger sample size, we could use a formula to calculate the likelihood
 of these events. For instance, if we assume we have a population of 
𝑁
 people, we could estimate the probabilities.

P(A): Probability of attending the facilitation session.

P(B|A): Probability of drowning given attending the session.

P(C): Probability of not attending the session and drowning.

Let's say 𝑁 people are considered, and the numbers reflect similar proportions:

Number of people attending the session: 𝑁𝐴

Number of people not attending the session: 
𝑁−𝑁𝐴

Then, the probabilities could be expressed as:

𝑃(𝐴)=𝑁𝐴/𝑁   
𝑃(𝐵∣𝐴)=(number of people drowning after attending) / 𝑁𝐴     
𝑃(𝐶)=(number of people drowning without attending) / (𝑁−𝑁𝐴)       
If you want to model this with a larger sample, you can define 
𝑁
 and then calculate expected numbers based on these probabilities. For example, with 
𝑁=1000:

If 50% attend the session: 
𝑁𝐴=500

If you estimate from your experience that 1 out of 2 attendees drowned: 
𝑃(𝐵∣𝐴)≈0.5

If 1 out of 2 non-attendees drowned: 
𝑃(𝐶)≈0.5

So, for 1000 people:

Expected attendees: 500

Expected drownings among attendees: 250

Expected non-attendees: 500

Expected drownings among non-attendees: 250

Therefore, you can expand this model as required and adjust the probabilities based on your extended observations.

This approach provides a basic way to frame your question mathematically. However
, please remember the limitations and sensitivities involved, and consider seeking
professional advice for more accurate and thorough analysis.
