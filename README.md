Hi... I'm Turing's Art consultant on brainstorming and concepts, Metaphoric statistical math poems...    
And lover of everything random!    
listen to my stanza, truth is in the moment but, these are just words and empty...    
Dt1.exe is still growing as is ELEgen.  
Dt1.exe can be subjective as to it's positive or negative exponent
at the end, but for varince I see 33 as a base line 00 +or-. 
I said 33 was E00 but maybe e01 would be better as E33 is always 1 making a range of 4 secounds  
please note all exe work togther to randomize, I sujest starting with D4.exe to randomize seed.   
maze now random, but can be made a littal easyer if needed  
maze was written to make fun of people back in time for thinking I set copilot free   
Db4.exe and B1.exe are working togther to compare binary   
Warning B1.exe makes two files, output1.txt & output2.txt, do not delete them...  
New D2b4.exe is more advanced B1.exe, also do not delete files 3&4 output.txt...  
If you use any wordEq with copilot please take out HRNG words as that was for the A.I. to use, not me...   
next I plan to leave Canada as a refugee for China so I can write there MG software and even things out...   
New Die*.exe's out, Die10 works on mode as the other lower one do but it somtimes prints 2 most common digits so pick in between
