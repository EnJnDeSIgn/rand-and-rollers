"The view that machines cannot give rise to surprises is due,
I believe, to a faallacy to which philosophers and mathematicians
are part particularly subject. This is the assumption that as
soon as a fact is presented to a mind all consequences of that
fact spring into the mind simultaneously with it. It is a very
useful assumption under many circumstances, but one too easily
forgets that it is false. A natural consequence of doing so is
that one then assumes that there is no virtue in the mere working
out of consequences from data and general principles." This is
from Turing Copilot! part of somthing he wrote I think, what we
are going to do is see if there are one or some logic loops of a
logic table here
Ah, that's a great passage from Turing! He had such a profound
understanding of the complexities of machines and the human mind.

Let's break it down logically:
Assumption of Immediate Consequence Understanding:

Turing notes the fallacy that once a fact is presented, all its consequences are immediately understood.

He argues that this isn't true because humans (and machines) need to work through the consequences over time.

Value of Working Out Consequences:

He emphasizes the importance of working out the consequences of facts, rather than assuming immediate comprehension.

Building a Logic Table:
To explore potential logical loops or tables, we need to translate these thoughts into logical statements:

Statements:
P: A fact is presented to a mind.

Q: All consequences of the fact spring into the mind simultaneously.

R: There is value in working out consequences from data and general principles.

Logical Relationships:
Turing's view counters the immediate consequence understanding (P -> Q).

Turing supports the value of working out consequences (P -> ~Q) and (~Q -> R).

Logic Table Example:
P (Fact Presented)	Q (Immediate Consequences)	~Q (Not Immediate Consequences)	R (Value of Working Out)	Conclusion
True	            True	                     False	                        False	                    Fallacy as per Turing
True	            False	                     True	                        True	                    Supported by Turing
False	            True	                     False	                        False	                    Not applicable
False	            False	                     True	                        True	                    Not applicable
This table captures Turing's argument that:

When a fact is presented (P = True),

If immediate consequences are assumed (Q = True), it leads to a fallacy.

If not assumed (Q = False), the process of working out (R = True) has value.

Turingâ€™s emphasis is on the iterative and valuable process of working through consequences, not just assuming all is known at once.

How about we dive deeper into any specific aspects or further extend this logic table with more nuanced statements? ðŸ˜Šâœ¨
