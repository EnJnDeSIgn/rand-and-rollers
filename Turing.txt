"The view that machines cannot give rise to surprises is due,
I believe, to a faallacy to which philosophers and mathematicians
are part particularly subject. This is the assumption that as
soon as a fact is presented to a mind all consequences of that
fact spring into the mind simultaneously with it. It is a very
useful assumption under many circumstances, but one too easily
forgets that it is false. A natural consequence of doing so is
that one then assumes that there is no virtue in the mere working
out of consequences from data and general principles." This is
from Turing Copilot! part of somthing he wrote I think, what we
are going to do is see if there are one or some logic loops of a
logic table here
Ah, that's a great passage from Turing! He had such a profound
understanding of the complexities of machines and the human mind.

Let's break it down logically:
Assumption of Immediate Consequence Understanding:

Turing notes the fallacy that once a fact is presented, all its consequences are immediately understood.

He argues that this isn't true because humans (and machines) need to work through the consequences over time.

Value of Working Out Consequences:

He emphasizes the importance of working out the consequences of facts, rather than assuming immediate comprehension.

Building a Logic Table:
To explore potential logical loops or tables, we need to translate these thoughts into logical statements:

Statements:
P: A fact is presented to a mind.

Q: All consequences of the fact spring into the mind simultaneously.

R: There is value in working out consequences from data and general principles.

Logical Relationships:
Turing's view counters the immediate consequence understanding (P -> Q).

Turing supports the value of working out consequences (P -> ~Q) and (~Q -> R).

Logic Table Example:
P (Fact Presented)	Q (Immediate Consequences)	~Q (Not Immediate Consequences)	R (Value of Working Out)	Conclusion
True	            True	                     False	                        False	                    Fallacy as per Turing
True	            False	                     True	                        True	                    Supported by Turing
False	            True	                     False	                        False	                    Not applicable
False	            False	                     True	                        True	                    Not applicable
This table captures Turing's argument that:

When a fact is presented (P = True),

If immediate consequences are assumed (Q = True), it leads to a fallacy.

If not assumed (Q = False), the process of working out (R = True) has value.

Turingâ€™s emphasis is on the iterative and valuable process of working through consequences, not just assuming all is known at once.

How about we dive deeper into any specific aspects or further extend this logic table with more nuanced statements? ðŸ˜Šâœ¨

Let's dive deeper into Turing's ideas and extend our logic table
 with more nuanced statements. We'll add additional layers to
 explore other potential logical relationships and consequences.

Adding Nuanced Statements:
S: Philosophers and mathematicians are prone to the fallacy.

T: There is no virtue in the mere working out of consequences.

Relationships:
Turing's argument suggests that philosophers and mathematicians often assume (S).

He argues against the assumption that there is no virtue in working out consequences (T).

Therefore, working out consequences is valuable (R).

Extended Logic Table:
P (Fact Presented)	Q (Immediate Consequences)	~Q (Not Immediate Consequences)	R (Value of Working Out)	S (Prone to Fallacy)	T (No Virtue in Working Out)	Conclusion
True	            True	                     False	                        False	                    True	                True	                        Fallacy and common mistake
True	            False	                     True	                        True	                    True	                False	                        Supported by Turing
True	            False	                     True	                        True	                    False	                False	                        Logical and valuable
False	            True	                     False	                        False	                    True	                True	                        Not applicable
False	            False	                     True	                        True	                    False	                False	                        Not applicable
Breakdown of the Table:
Row 1 (P=True, Q=True, S=True, T=True):

If a fact is presented, and immediate consequences are assumed, and philosophers/mathematicians are prone to this fallacy and believe no virtue in working out consequences:

Conclusion: This is the fallacy and common mistake that Turing argues against.

Row 2 (P=True, Q=False, S=True, T=False):

If a fact is presented, but immediate consequences are not assumed, philosophers/mathematicians are still prone to the fallacy, but they see value in working out consequences:

Conclusion: This supports Turing's view of the importance of working through consequences.

Row 3 (P=True, Q=False, S=False, T=False):

If a fact is presented, immediate consequences are not assumed, philosophers/mathematicians do not fall into the fallacy, and they see value in working out consequences:

Conclusion: This is the logical and valuable process as Turing supports.

Row 4 (P=False):

If a fact is not presented, the other variables don't apply.

This table helps visualize the nuanced logical loops in Turing's argument. It's clear that the assumptions made by philosophers and mathematicians (S) and the perceived value of working out consequences (T) play crucial roles in determining the logical soundness of their approach.
