Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

It's almost funny that I can go on about,
how less is more but, it's not funny to
go on about it, because you really can go
on about it forever never stoping ever.

more and more about how less is better,
better to stop and not go on about it.

less and less, better and better.
