program bell_curve
! In statistics, the bell curve is often associated with the
! normal distribution, which is a probability distribution
! that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near
! the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from
! the mean. The equation for the normal distribution is:
! f(x)=σ2π​1​e−21​(σx−μ​)2
! Here’s what each symbol represents:

! ( f(x) ): Probability density function (pdf)
! ( x ): The variable
! ( \mu ): Mean of the distribution
! ( \sigma ): Standard deviation of the distribution
! ( \pi ): Mathematical constant Pi (approximately 3.14159)
! ( e ): Euler’s number (approximately 2.71828)

! The normal distribution is characterized by the mean and
! the standard deviation. The mean determines the location of
! the center of the graph, and the standard deviation
! determines the height and width of the graph
! When comparing two bell curves (normal distributions), you
! would look at their means and standard deviations. If the
! means are different, the curves will be centered at
! different points on the x-axis. If the standard deviations
! are different, one curve will be wider or narrower than the
! other
! To compare the distributions quantitatively, statisticians
! often use z-scores, which measure the distance of a score
! from the mean in units of standard deviation. This allows
! for comparison between different normal distributions
