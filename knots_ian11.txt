Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris


a voice spoke the statement because the finger had a point

the ear hears the statement but does not know how to point

the brain makes all the fingers poke it to get a better
feel of all the points that were yet to have a statment

the tongue wiggles and says:
is interesting
is not interesting
tastes good
does not taste good
