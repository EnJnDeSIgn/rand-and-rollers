Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

They spend what they earn not because they cannot save,
but because each want arrives dressed as a need.
They borrow not because they lack enough,
but because the next desire promises to complete the last.
They try to save what remains,
but nothing remains because every want insists it cannot wait.
They try to put saving first,
but the world tells them that happiness comes second,
and happiness must be purchased.
They confuse wants for needs
because the media teaches them to feel incomplete.
They feel incomplete
because each purchase offers only enough satisfaction
to reveal the next incompleteness.
And the more they try to escape the cycle,
the more the cycle convinces them
that escape itself is something they must buy.
