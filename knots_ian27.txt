Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

the eye sees the want
because the want presents itself
as if it were a need with a point
the ear hears the want
but cannot tell
whether the point is sharp
or merely shiny
the brain sends all the fingers
to poke the point
to feel whether it is necessary
or only pretending to be
the fingers press and press
but each point that feels complete
reveals another point
still waiting to be felt
the tongue wiggles and says:
is needed
is only wanted
tastes full
tastes empty
and the more the tongue tries to taste wisely
the more every taste insists
it must be tasted now
and the more the ear tries to ignore the call
the louder the want speaks
as if silence itself
must be purchased
