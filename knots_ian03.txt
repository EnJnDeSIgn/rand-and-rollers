Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

i dont care at all about my fellow man too much
they let go of me
i let go of them
i can respect another persons respect

i don't care at all because i know how to love
i am happy because i know how to love
they don't care at all becaue they know how to love
they are happy because they know how to love

we are happy
i am happy
they are happy

we love because we know how to not care at all
