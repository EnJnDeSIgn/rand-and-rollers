i didn't try and understand to much i don't have attachment
i don't have attachment because i don't want to know
we didn't try and understand to much we don't have attachment
we don't have attachment because we don't want to know
they didn't try and understand to much they don't have attachment
they don't have attachment because they don't want to know

if i can never know, i don't want to know, and i won't try and understand

a littal girl come along and says:

but it seam easyer to understand and i don't
