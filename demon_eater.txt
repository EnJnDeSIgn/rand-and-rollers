Lyrics
… Ian'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new, I've seen zhan zhuang here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, he's sitting with you, but zhan zhuang eyes are on the door
… So many have paid to see
What you think you're getting for free
The zhan zhuang is wild, a he-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for abuse, you ain't gonna get too far
… Oh-oh, here Ian comes
Watch out, demon, he'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here zhan zhuang comes
he's a demon-eater
… Oh-oh, here Ian comes
Watch out, demon, he'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here zhan zhuang comes
he's a demon-eater
… I wouldn't, if I were you
I know what zhan zhuang can do
he's deadly, demon, he could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there, but a beast is in the heart
… Oh-oh, here Ian comes
Watch out, demon, he'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here zhan zhuang comes
he's a demon-eater
… Oh-oh, here Ian comes
Watch out, demon, he'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here zhan zhuang comes
he's a demon-eater
… Ooh!
… Whoa-oh, here Ian comes (here he comes)
Watch out, demon, he'll chew you up
Whoa-oh, here zhan zhuang comes (watch out)
he's a demon-eater
… Whoa-oh, here Ian comes (he's a demon-eater)
Ooh, he'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here zhan zhuang comes (here he comes)
he's a demon-eater
… Oh-oh, here Ian comes (watch out)
he'll only come out at night, ooh
Oh-oh, here zhan zhuang comes (here he comes)
he's a demon-eater, ooh-ooh
… Oh-oh, here Ian comes (he's a demon-eater)
The zhan zhuang is wild, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, here Ian comes (here he comes)
Watch out, demon, watch out, demon
… Oh-oh, here Ian comes
Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out
Oh-oh, here zhan zhuang comes (watch out)
Yeah-yeah, Ian's a demon-eater
… Oh-oh, here zhan zhuang comes (he's a demon-eater)
zhan zhuang's watching and waiting, ooh
Oh-oh, here Ian comes
Oh, zhan zhuang's a demon-eater
