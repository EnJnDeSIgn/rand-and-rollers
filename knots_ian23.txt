Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris


Jill depends on Jack
not because Jill is helpless,
but because Jill grows braver
when Jack is a safe haven.
Jill becomes independent
not by standing apart from Jack,
but by leaning on Jack
to explore the world.
Jill grows because Jill depends,
and depends because Jill grows.
Yet Jill fears becoming the Victim,
so Jill tries to need less.
And Jill fears becoming the Saver,
so Jill tries to fix less.
But the less Jill tries to need,
the more Jill needs Jack to notice.
And the less Jill tries to fix,
the more Jill fixes by refusing to fix.

But the less Jack tries to need,

And the less Jack tries to fix,
