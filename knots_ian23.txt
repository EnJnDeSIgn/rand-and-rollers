Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris


They rely on each other not because they are helpless,
but because each becomes braver when the other is a safe haven.
They become independent not by standing apart,
but by leaning on the one who lets them explore.
They grow because they depend,
and they depend because they grow.
Yet each fears becoming the Victim,
so each tries to need less.
And each fears becoming the Saver,
so each tries to fix less.
But the more they try not to need,
the more they need the other to notice.
And the more they try not to fix,
the more they fix by refusing to fix.
