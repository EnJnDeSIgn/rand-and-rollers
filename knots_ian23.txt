Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris


Jill depends on Jack
not because Jill is helpless,
but because Jill grows braver
when Jack is a safe haven.
Jill becomes independent
not by standing apart from Jack,
but by leaning on Jack
to explore the world.
Jill grows because Jill depends,
and depends because Jill grows.
Yet Jill fears becoming the Victim,
so Jill tries to need less.
And Jill fears becoming the Saver,
so Jill tries to fix less.
But the less Jill tries to need,
the more Jill needs Jack to notice.
And the less Jill tries to fix,
the more Jill fixes by refusing to fix.

Jack depends on Jill
not because Jack is helpless,
but because Jack grows braver
when Jill is a safe haven.
Jack becomes independent
not by standing apart from Jill,
but by leaning on Jill
to explore the world.
Jack grows because Jack depends,
and depends because Jack grows.
Yet Jack fears becoming the Victim,
so Jack tries to need less.
And Jack fears becoming the Saver,
so Jack tries to fix less.
But the less Jack tries to need,
the more Jack needs Jill to notice.
And the less Jack tries to fix,
the more Jack fixes by refusing to fix.

Jill depends on Jack
not because Jill is weak,
but because Jill grows braver
when Jack is a safe haven.
Jill becomes independent
not by standing apart,
but by leaning on Jack
to step into the world.
Jill grows because Jill depends,
and depends because Jill grows.
Yet Jill fears becoming the Victim,
so Jill tries to need less.
And Jill fears becoming the Saver,
so Jill tries to fix less.
But the less Jill tries to need,
the more Jill needs Jack to see the effort.
And the less Jill tries to fix,
the more Jill fixes by refusing to fix.
So in trying not to be the Victim,
Jill becomes the one who needs.
And in trying not to be the Saver,
Jill becomes the one who saves
by not saving.
