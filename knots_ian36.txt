Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

If you want to love someone, first
you must learn to love yourself

If you hurt anyone eles you
will only hurt youself

If you hurt yourself you havent
learned to love your self

If you hurt yourself to not
hurt someone eles, you

may be hurting someone eles or
you may be hurting yourself

If we learn something the hurt
may be less then how much we
learned to love ourself
