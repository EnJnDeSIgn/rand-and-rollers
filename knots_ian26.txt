Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

And together, Jill and Jack create the very roles they fear,
for each tries so hard not to need
that the other must become the one who is needed.
And each tries so hard not to save
that the other must become the one who must be saved.
So Jill becomes Victim to spare Jack from being Saver,
and Jack becomes Saver to spare Jill from being Victim.
And in trying not to trap each other,
they trap each other
in the effort not to trap.

And each tries so hard not to save

They depend on each other not because they are weak,
but because each becomes stronger when the other is a refuge.
Yet each fears needing too much,
so each tries to need less.
And each fears fixing too much,
so each tries to fix less.
But the less they try to need,
the more they need the other to see they do not need.
And the less they try to fix,
the more they fix by refusing to fix.
So in fleeing Victim they become the one who needs,
and in fleeing Saver they become the one who saves.
And together they create the very roles they fear,
for each tries not to trap the other
and traps the other
in the effort not to trap.
