Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris


jack couldnt let go of jill
jill will never love jack
jill couldnt let go of jack
jack will never love jill

they will never love each other
they still love the one that is
easyest to let go of

jack let go of jill
jill let go of jack

and so...

jill will still be with jack
jack will still be with jill

but still...

jill let go of jack
jack let go of jill
