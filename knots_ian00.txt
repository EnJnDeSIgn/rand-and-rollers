Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

thoughs that are hard to let go of
are disgusinglly evil.
espesally when they make someone
hard to let go of.

he lets go of him
she lets go of her
he lets go of her
she lets go of him

they have to let go of them
we have let go of her
he let go of them
we have let go of him
she let go of they

we let go of you
you let go of us
they let go of me
