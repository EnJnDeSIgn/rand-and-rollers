Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

It's not that I think someone is gross,
when I feel something gross.

It's that I have been through so much gross,
that it really feels gross to do to someone
eles that witch makes me feel gross, with out
even asking if we can be gross togter or not

and I can't even explain why is also gross
