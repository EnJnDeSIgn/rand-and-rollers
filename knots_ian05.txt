Ian's new knots: by Ian J Norris

trying to understand too much can be attachment
attachment can be trying to understand too much

a dream is attachment if you try and understand
there is alway more to understand in a dream
if you try and understand a dream is attachment
more to understand in a dream there is alway more

there is always more because there is aways less
if you try and understand it is attachment
attachment is less if you don't want to know

i don't want to know if i can never know
we don't want to know if we can never know
they don't want to know if they can never know
